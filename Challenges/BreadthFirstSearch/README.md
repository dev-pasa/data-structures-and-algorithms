# Breadth First Binary Tree Traversal
Breadth first traversal of a Tree data structure.

## Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited node’s value.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O of the algorithm is O(N). I will traverse through the entire nodes in the binary tree.
