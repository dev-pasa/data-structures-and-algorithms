# Stack with queue
The goal is to create Stack with queue properties. Create stack methods that behaves the same way as a queue. 

## Challenge
Challege is to create a method that adds valeus in stacks but when dequeuing the value, we get the value at the very bottom. Same as first in firts out. 

## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O of the Dequeue algorithm is O(N) but for push and enqueue is O(1).


## Solution
