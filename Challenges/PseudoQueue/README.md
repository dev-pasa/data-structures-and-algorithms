# Stack with queue
The goal is to create Stack with queue properties. Create stack methods that behaves the same way as a queue. 

## Challenge
Challege is to create a method that adds values in stacks but when dequeuing the stack, we get the value at the very bottom instead of the top. Same as first in first out(FIFO). 

## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O of the Dequeue algorithm is O(N) but for push and enqueue is O(1).
