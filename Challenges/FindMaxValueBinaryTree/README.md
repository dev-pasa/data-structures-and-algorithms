# Find Max Value Binary Tree
Traverse through the tree and find the maximum node value in the tree.  

## Challenge


## Approach & Efficiency
Create a method that takes a Node root. Create a Binary tree and pass the root value of the binary tree. 
1. Time Complexity BigO for Binary tree traversal and FindMaxValue in Binary Tree is O(n).
2. Time Complexity BigO for Binary Search tree traversal is O(log n).
3. Space Complexity BigO for Binary tree traversal is O(h). The height of the tree. 

## API
** Max node value inside Binary Tree **
Create a FindMaxValue method that outputs the max value in the tree.
