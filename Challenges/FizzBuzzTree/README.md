# FizzBuzz Tree


## Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.
Instead of changing the values of the nodes, output to the console the new values respectively.


## Approach & Efficiency
Time Complexity = O(n): Must traverse the whole tree
Space Compexity = O(h): Where h is the height of the tree
