# First-in, First out Animal Shelter.
The goal is to create an animalShelter queue that outputs the first animal type from the queue. The user can also input the animal object at the end. 


## Challenge
Being able to create a new queue without using existing data structures and getting them to perform in certain way. 

## Approach & Efficiency
Approach is to create a doubly linked list where you can add value at the end of the list and traverse through the whole thing. 

## Solution
