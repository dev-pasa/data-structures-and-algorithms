# Binary Max Depth

## `Challenge`
* Find the Depth of the tree.
* Return an int value that represents the depth of the binary tree. 


## Approach & Efficiency
* Time Complexity = O(n): Must traverse the whole tree
* Space Compexity = O(1): Where h is the height of the tree

## Solution

## API
* A method traverses through the entire tree and finds the depth of the tree.
