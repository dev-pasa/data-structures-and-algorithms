#Find the Kth node from the last node

#Challenge
Write a function where given a list, find the kth node from the last node.

#Approach & Efficiency
Find the nth node using while loop. 
#BigO for this problem is O(n).
Space complexity is O(n)

#Solution
I did two loops for this problem. First to find the count of the list, then to count backward to the kth node. Given a kth value, when the loop starts from the end, the current head stops at the kth node.
