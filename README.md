# Data-structures-and-algorithms

* The goal is to learn data strctures and algorithms using C#. This is my learning experience using a strictly typed object oriented language. Through out the process I will analyze the theoretical running times of operations on the data structures.

## My primary focus will be on three main things:
* Correctness: The data structure should correctly implement its interface. Use testing for validation and also try to include separtion of concerts for better algorithm pattern. 
* Time complexity: The running times of operations on the data structure should be as small as possible.
* Space complexity: The data structure should use as little memory as possible.

## Challenges:
