# Data-structures-and-algorithms

* The goal is to learn data strctures and algorithms using C#. This is my learning experience using a strictly typed object oriented language. Through out the process I will analyze the theoretical running times of operations on the data structures.

## My primary focus will be on three main things:
* Correctness: The data structure should correctly implement its interface.
* Time complexity: The running times of operations on the data structure should be as small as possible.
* Space complexity: The data structure should use as little memory as possible.

## Challenges:

1. [Array Shift](Challenges/ArrayShift/README.md)
- `A function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available returns an array with the new value added at the middle index of the given array.`

2. [Binary Search](Challenges/BinarySearch/README.md)
- `Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available returns the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or returns -1 if the element does not exist.`

3. [Tree Height](Challenges/BinaryTreeHeight/README.md)
- `Find the height of the tree.`

4. [Binary Tree Sum of Odds](Challenges/BinaryTreeSumOfOdds/README.md)

6. [Fibonacci Sequence](Challenges/Fibonacci/README.md)
- `Write a function called Fibonacci which takes in a integer and returns a fibonacci number to it.`

7. [Queue Animal Shelter](Challenges/FifoAnimalShelter/README.md)
- `Learning queue data structure using objects. Create an Animal Shelter class that only accepts Cats or Dogs, and can Dequeue a Cat, a Dog, or the animal that has been in the shelter the longest.`

8. [Max Value Binary Tree](Challenges/FindMaxValueBinaryTree/README.md)
- `Write a method that returns the maximum value in a Binary Tree of numeric values.`

9. [FizzBuzz Tree](Challenges/FizzBuzzTree/README.md)
- `Replaces all the integer values in a binary tree with "Fizz" if they are divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both.`

10. [Generate Balanced Paretheses](Challenges/GenerateBalancedParethesesCombinations/BalancedParenthe)
- `For a given integer n, generate all possible permutations of n pairs of parentheses, with all permutations being "code-legal"`

11. [Is Tree Balanced?](Challenges/IsBinaryTreeBalanced/README.md)

12. [Linked List kth Node From End](Challenges/KthNodeFromEnd/README.md)
- `Add a new method to the LinkedList class that takes in an integer k and returns the value kth from the end of the array.`

13. [HashTable Left Join](Challenges/LeftJoin/README.md)
- `Perform a LEFT JOIN on two hash tables.`

14. [Merge Linked List](Challenges/MergeLinkedList/README.md)
