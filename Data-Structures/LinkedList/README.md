#Singly Linked List
Create a Singly Linked List

#Challenge
Within the LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

#Test
For each method created in the Linked list class, perform three tests.
