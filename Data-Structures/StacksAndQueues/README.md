# Stacks and Queues
Stacks and Queues are data structures that can be beneficial when using first in first out or last in first out methods of handling nodes or data. 
They can help users with many differnt applications, one being palindrome testing of values. 

## Challenge
Challenges involved creating test that met the requirements for this data structures. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
There wasn't much processing involved for dequeue, enqueue, pop and top methods. They returned a primitive value. 
Both time and space complexity for all the methods were O(1).
## API
For queue data structure peek, dequeue and enqueue are publicly available. For Stack push, pop and peek methods are publicly available.
