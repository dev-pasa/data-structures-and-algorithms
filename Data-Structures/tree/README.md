# Trees
create a binary search and binary search tree with traversal. 

## Challenge

1. Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

2. Create a BinarySearchTree class
Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.



## Approach & Efficiency
First I created a node class, then Binary Search which had inorder, preorder and post order traversal. 
I than create a binary search tree class that inherited the properties of binary search. 

## API
The application does not use external APIs.
